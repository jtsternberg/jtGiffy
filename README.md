jtGiffy - WordPress Plugin
=======

Give JSON access to your gifs. C'mon, share the love!

Install plugin the usual way.

This plugin works with a standard directory of images/gifs within your WordPress site structure (something like `http://your-wordpresss-site.com/gifs`). If your gifs live somewhere else, this plugin is probably not for you.

To set the location of your gifs (the default location is /gifs), go to your site and add `?jtgiffy_url=http://**YOURSITE**/gifs` to the url. You will only need to do this one time, and it will save the option with the location of your gif folder.
